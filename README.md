This project is created specifically for Monik's birthday website surprise. I use ChatGPT to do all the coding work (basically vibe code lol). And here is the first prompt that I use:

Page 1:
Display a quiz
Quiz: What day is it today?
A.	5th August > Correct! Happy birthday, Monik (display for 3 seconds). > go to page 2
B.	National Underwear Day > Incorrect! Who cares about your underwear? (try again button)
C.	My birthday > Incorrect. Bro, not everything is about you. (try again button)

Page 2: 
-	Display cake and happy birthday text with some design
-	Add a birthday meme song
- After the song ends, prompt users to blow out the candle
- Go to page 3 after the blow
  
Page 3: Matching picture pairs game to unlock the birthday gift (page 4)
-	There are 9 cards displayed in 3 rows and 3 columns. 
-	Each card contains a picture on the other side. There are 3 pairs of cards, with each pair having the same 3 pictures displaying randomly.
-	If the users open or click on the same picture pair, it will appear without closing. 
-	But if users open a different card after, all the cards will close
-	The game will end after all the cards appear, then auto go to the next page 4
  
Page 4:
-	There are 6 boxes on display
-	Each boxes represent a gifts
-	Boxes contain 4 birthday card pages, a QR to a playlist page, and a rick-rolled video page
-	After opening a box, there is a next button for users can click on. And it will take users to the gift page, but the boxes that have  already been clicked on will go transparent can cannot be clicked.
-	After users open all 6 boxes, the game will restart.

Note: This is a good first prompt; however, you still need to make more adjustments and some touch-ups to get what you want.
